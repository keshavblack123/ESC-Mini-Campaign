Submission for Week 8 code:
The file CSVCompare.java compares 2 CSV files and outputs any different data in the lines of the CSV file.
To run it, first clone the repository and open it on Android Studio

Simply run the program as it is to compare the 2 sample files  
If you wish to compare other sample files, you could drop them in the Week 8 folder and change the filepaths in the main function to the name of your CSV file:  
`String file1Path = globalPath + "/sample_file_1.csv";`  
`String file3Path = globalPath + "/sample_file_3.csv";`
